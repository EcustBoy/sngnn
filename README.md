# Introduction

This repository contains the work done by Robocomp on social navigation and particularly using Graph neural networks.
It contains the following repository.
1. SNGNN1D
2. SONATA

SNGNN1D (Social Navigation Graph Neural Network 1D) is used to evaluate the robot based on the static social scene 
generated randomly. The work done was a part of GSoC '19 program.

SONATA is a toolkit used to collect data for dynamic social scenario. This is currently under work and part of the GSoC
